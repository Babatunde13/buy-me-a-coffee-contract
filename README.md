# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm run help
npm run test
GAS_REPORT=true npm run test
npm start
npm run deploy:local
npm run deploy <host>
```
